The app allows a user to add a route, of any name/type/grade/location, which can then be searched by anybody using the built in Route Finder. The user can also view their profile of submitted climbs, and delete their account if they choose to. It is a full CRUD, MERN stack application. I began building this during my time with General Assembly.",
